\section{Subgroups and Group Functions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \marginnote{10/17:}Let $\sigma\in S_n$ be an $n$-cycle, and let $\tau\in S_n$ be a 2-cycle. Show by constructing a counterexample that there exists a choice $\sigma,\tau,n$ such that $\gen{\sigma,\tau}\neq S_n$. Bonus Question: Determine for which $n$ such an example exists.
    \item Shuffling Redux. Let $G$ be the subgroup generated by the union of the following elements.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(n,53-n)$ for all $n$;
        \item The element $(1,2,\dots,26)(52,51,\dots,27)$ of order 26;
        \item The element $(1,2)(51,52)$.
    \end{itemize}
    With this definition in mind, respond to the following.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $H=\gen{(n,53-n)\mid n\in[52]}$. Prove that $H\cong(\Z/2\Z)^{26}$ inside $S_{52}$.
        \item Show that there is a homomorphism $\phi:G\to S_{26}$ such that\dots
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\phi$ is surjective;
            \item $\ker\phi=H$.
        \end{enumerate}
        (It follows from this that $G$ has order $2^{26}\cdot 26!=27064431817106664380040216576000000$.)
        \item Prove that the group generated by the two riffle shuffles is a subgroup of $G$. (In fact, they are equal.)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $g,h\in G$ both have order 2. Determine the possible orders of $gh$.
    \item Suppose that the map $\phi:G\to G$ given by $\phi(x)=x^2$ is a homomorphism. Prove that $G$ is abelian.
    \item Call a subgroup $H\subset G$ \textbf{cyclic} if $H=\gen{g}=\gen{g,g^{-1}}$ for some $g\in G$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Prove that any cyclic subgroup $H\subset G$ is abelian.
        \item Prove that any cyclic subgroup $H\subset G$ is either isomorphic to $\Z$ or to $\Z/n\Z$, and that the latter happens exactly when $h$ has finite order $n$.
        \item Let $G$ be any group. Prove that there is a bijection between the set of homomorphisms $\{\phi:\Z\to G\}$ and $G$ given by
        \begin{equation*}
            \phi \mapsto \phi(1)
        \end{equation*}
        (Exercise 2.3.19 of \textcite{bib:DummitFoote}.)
        \item Exhibit a proper subgroup of $\Q$ which is not cyclic. (Exercise 2.4.15 of \textcite{bib:DummitFoote}.)
        \item Let $G$ be a finite group. Prove that $G$ is equal to the union of its proper subgroups if and only if it is not cyclic.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Let $p$ be prime, and let $G=\text{GL}_2(\F_p)$ be the group of invertible $2\times 2$ matrices modulo $p$. Prove that $|G|=(p^2-1)(p^2-p)$. (See \S 1.4 of \textcite{bib:DummitFoote}.)
\end{enumerate}
