\chapter{Simple Groups}
\section{Simple Groups I}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{11/28:}\textbf{Simple} (group): A group $G$ for which the only normal subgroups of $G$ are $G$ and itself, i.e., $H\triangleleft G$ implies $H=G$ or $H=\{e\}$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple does not mean "easy" but means "cannot be broken up into pieces."
        \item By analogy, think of atoms as indivisible.
        \item If you have $G$ and $H\triangleleft G$, you get $H$ and $G/H$, and you can think of $G$ as being made up of $H,G/H$. Together, these two groups convey quite a bit of information about $G$.
        \item Warning: $H,G/H$ do \emph{not} determine $G$; just a lot of information about it.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: Let $H=\Z/2\Z$ and $G/H=\Z/2\Z$. Then we could have $G=(\Z/2\Z)^2$ or $G=\Z/4\Z$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Idea: If you want to classify all finite groups, you might start with all finite simple groups, knowing that finite nonsimple groups can in some way be described by its simple quotients and subgroups.
    \item Problem I (Classification): Classify all finite simple groups.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A bit like understanding all prime numbers first in order to understand all composite numbers.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Problem II (Extension problem): Given $A,B$, understand all $G$ such that $A\triangleleft G$ and $G/A\cong B$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We can build back up to $G$ with $A\times B$ or other ways.
        \item We'll talk about this one less than problem I.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Examples:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $p$ be prime. Then $G=\Z/p\Z$ is a simple group.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Follows directly form Lagrange's theorem.
            \item It's even stronger than simple; the only \emph{subgroups} (let alone normal subgroups) of $\Z/p\Z$ are $\Z/p\Z$ and $\{e\}$.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Let $n\geq 5$ and let $G=A_n$. Then $A_n$ is a simple group.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item More interesting and intricate. Has many subgroups but the only \emph{normal} ones are itself and the trivial one.
            \item Note that $A_3$ is also simple, but cyclic and abelian as well, so it got classified with the above.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item What does it mean to classify simple groups?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start by asking what are the simple groups of some particular order.
        \item Start with groups of a certain factorization or those with small order.
        \item In this series of lectures, we'll focus on groups of small order. Can we understand for order below 100, 200, or 300?
        \item What's important: Less the classification, more the application of techniques we've used. Fancier techniques needed for bigger $n$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Things in math aren't always hard because the technique is hard; they're hard because knowing what technique to use is hard. This is the challenge here.
    \item The prime factorization of the order says a lot about the group and allows us to make various conclusions.
    \item Theorem: Let $p$ be prime. Suppose that $|G|=p^n$. Then if $G$ is simple, we have $|G|=p$ and $G\cong\Z/p\Z$.
    \begin{proof}
        If $G$ is a $p$-group, then $Z(G)\neq\{e\}$.\par
        Case 1: $G=Z(G)$, so $G$ is abelian. Therefore, let $g\in G$ have order $p$ and let $H=\gen{g}\neq\{e\}$. If $G$ is simple, then $H=G$ and therefore $|G|=p$.\par
        Case 2: $G$ is not abelian. Take $H=Z(G)\neq G$. We know that $Z(G)\triangleleft G$, so $G$ is not simple, a contradition.
    \end{proof}
    \item Takeaway: $|G|=2$ is simple, but $|G|=4,8,16,\dots$ are all not simple.
    \item The general $p^iq^j$ case is very sophisticated, so we'll start simple.
    \item Lemma 1: Let $|G|=pq$ where $p,q$ are distinct primes. Then $G$ is not simple.
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $G$ is simple with $|G|=pq$. WLOG, let $p>q$.
        WTS: One of the Sylow subgroups will be normal. The normal one is the one with greater order (motivation: $D_{2n}$; it's often useful to consider the $p$-Sylow subgroups for the largest $p$).
        What do we know? From the Sylow theorems, $n_p\cong 1\mod p$ and $n_p\mid q$ (we know that $|N|=|G|/n_p=pq/n_p$, but since $n_p\equiv 1\mod p$, $n_p\nmid p$, so it must be that $n_p\mid q$). $p>q$ implies $q\not\equiv 1\pmod p$. Thus, $n_p=1$. This is a contradiction: If there's only 1 $p$-Sylow subgroup, then that $p$-Sylow is normal (because all $p$-Sylows are conjugate, so one $p$-Sylow means its in its own conjugacy class).
    \end{proof}
    \item We use a contradiction argument every time.
    \item Lemma 2: Let $|G|=pqr$. Then $G$ is not simple.
    \begin{proof}
        Strategy (again): Apply Sylow theorems and get information.\par
        WLOG, let $p>q>r$. We have that $n_p\equiv 1\pmod p$ and $n_p\mid qr$. $n_p\in\{1,q,r,qr\}$. If $n_p\equiv 1\pmod p$, the $p$-Sylow is normal in $G$, a contradiction. $q,r\not\equiv 1\mod p$, so we eliminate those cases, too. One case left: $qr$. We thus deduce that $n_p=qr$.\par
        New technique: Because of these congruences, the number of $p$-Sylows cannot be really small (congruence obstructions). But we also know that it can't be too big. If there are that many elements of order $p$, we will crowd out the elements of other orders. We know that $n_q\equiv 1\mod q$, and $n_q\mid pr$. $n_q=1$ gives a contradiction. $n_q\not\equiv r$ because $n>r$. Thus, $n_q\in\{p,pr\}$. Doing the same thing for $n_r$, we get three possibilities: $p,q,pr$. Next step: Count elements. How many elements of order $p$ are in $G$?\par
        Proposition: If $p\mid |G|$ exactly, then any two distinct $p$-Sylows have only trivial intersection. The number of $g\in G$ of order $p$ is equal to $n_p(p-1)$.\par
        Because $p$ exactly divides $p$, each $p$-Sylow is a subgroup of order $p$, but their intersection is a subgroup and thus has to divide the order (Lagrange's theorem). Thus, the order of the intersection is either 1 or $p$. Thus, all elements of order $p$ lie in trivially intersecting $p$-Sylows. We count $p-1$ elements of order $p$ for each $p$-Sylow ($p$ minus the identity).\par
        Thus, since $p\,||\,|G|$ in this case, we know that the number of $g\in G$ with $|g|=p$ is $n_p(p-1)=qr(p-1)$. The number of $g\in G$ with $|g|=q$ is $n_q(q-1)\geq p(q-1)$. The number of $g\in G$ with $|g|=r$ is $n_r(r-1)\geq q(r-1)$. Counting the number of elements and the identity, we get
        \begin{equation*}
            qr(p-1)+p(q-1)+q(r-1)+1 = qrp+pq-p-q+1
            = pqr+(p-1)(q-1)
            > pqr
            = |G|
        \end{equation*}
        a contradiction.
    \end{proof}
    \item This has to fail eventually, though --- we know $A_5$ is simple for instance, and it has prime factorization $2^2\cdot 3\cdot 5$, so $pqr^2$ can be simple.
    \item Thus, we now turn to other types of factorizations.
    \item Thus, consider variations of the two primes case.
    \item First, new technique.
    \item Lemma 3: Let $G\subset S_4$ is simple. Then $|G|=2,3$.
    \begin{proof}
        If we have a homomorphism from a simple group to any other group, it is either trivial or injective (our group doesn't break up; it either injects fully or disappears completely). We know that $\ker\phi\triangleleft G$, so if $G$ is simple, either $\ker\phi=\{e\}$ (injective) or $\ker\phi=G$ (trivial).\par
        We know that $A_4\triangleleft S_4\twoheadrightarrow S_4/A_4\cong\Z/2\Z$. Now let $G\triangleleft S_4$. We can apply a homomorphism to get a map from $G\to S_4/A_4$. It follows by the above claim that the homomorphism is either trivial or injective.\par
        Let $\Gamma$ be a group with $A\triangleleft\Gamma$. Let $\Gamma/A=B$. If $G\hookrightarrow\Gamma$ is simple, then either $G\hookrightarrow A$ or $G\hookrightarrow\Gamma/A=B$. Proof: We have $G\to\Gamma\to\Gamma/A=B$. Case 1: $G$ injects into $B$, so we get the latter claim. Case 2: the map is trivial, so everything in $G$ maps to the identity in $B=\Gamma/A$. Then $G\leq A$. So if we know how to divide our group up, we can make something of the pieces.\par
        Returning to our example, we have $A_r\triangleleft S_4$, $S_4/A_4=\Z/2\Z$, so $G\hookrightarrow A_4$, $G\hookrightarrow\Z/2\Z$. In the latter case, it has order 2. We have $K\triangleleft A_4$ and $A_4/K\equiv\Z/3\Z$. So either $G\leq K$ or $G\leq\Z/3\Z$. The first one implies since $K=(\Z/2\Z)^2$ that $G\triangleleft\Z/2\Z$.
    \end{proof}
    \item Groups of order 2,3 are trivially simple, so it's kind of meaningless, but doesn't matter; the lemma still holds.
    \item We narrowed in on the case of $S_4$ in order to prove our next theorem.
    \item Lemma 4 (No small actions): Let $G$ be a simple group, and suppose $G\acts X$ transitively, where $|X|=2,3,4$. Then $|G|=2,3$.
    \begin{proof}
        Given a transitive action, we get a homomorphism $G\to S_X$. Transitivity and $|X|\geq 2$ implies the homomorphism is nontrivial. But since $G$ is simple, $G\hookrightarrow S_X$. But since $|X|\leq 4$, this means that $G\hookrightarrow S_4$. We now use Lemma 3. This means that $|G|=2,3$.\par
        See lemma 6 for the kind of group action we are talking about??
    \end{proof}
    \item Corollary: If $p\mid |G|$, $p$ is prime, $G$ is simple, $|G|\neq 2,3,p$, then $n_p\neq 1,2,3,4$.
    \item Next time: At the same time these videos release, there will be a blog post with the statements of these lemmas and maybe some words on them.
\end{itemize}



\section{Office Hours (Abhijit)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What do we need to know about the affine group of order $p$, as discussed in Lecture 8.1?
    \item Friday's office hours will be the last one unless Frank changes something. If the Twitch stream actually happens, Abhijit isn't sure what day it would be. Frank is currently traveling.
    \item HW8 2c requires 2d.
    \item Abhijit will email me more info on the $A_5$ question that he "beat a tactical retreat from."
\end{itemize}



\section{Simple Groups II}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{11/30:}Lemma 5: Assume $|G|=2p^n,3p^n,4p^n$. $p$ is a prime, and for $mp^n$, $m\neq p$. Then $G$ is not simple.
    \begin{proof}
        We again look at $p$-Sylows and how many are there. $n_p$ must divide the order of the group and not divide $p$ in these cases. Therefore, $n_p=1,2,3,4$, so as in Lemma 4, we have a very small set for $G$ to act on. Thus, by Lemma 4, $G$ is not simple.
    \end{proof}
    \item Beefing this up a bit.
    \item Lemma 6: Assume $|G|=5p^n$. Then $G$ is not simple.
    \begin{proof}
        Only interesting case: $n_p=5$. In this case, we get an action of $G$ on 5 points, namely the transitive action of $G$ on the 5 $p$-Sylows by conjugation. Thus, we get an injective map $G\to S_5$, so $G\leq 5$ and has order $5p^n$.
        Additionally, since $n_p=5\equiv 1\pmod p$, we know that $p=2$.
        What else can we say? We now look at $n_5$. We know from Sylow III that $n_5\equiv 1\mod 5$ and $n_5\mid(p^n=2^n)$, so $2^n\geq 16$ (since $16\equiv 1\mod 5$ and $16$ divides a power of 2). Thus, $|G|$ divides 16, but $|S_5|=120$ which is not divisible by 16, a contradiction.
    \end{proof}
    \item See again the procedure of "assume it's simple; derive a contradiction."
    \item Lemma 7: Assume $|G|=6p^n$. Then $G$ is not simple.
    \begin{proof}
        We know that $n_p\mid 6$, so $n_p=1,2,3,6$. Lemma 4: $n_p=6$. Sylow III: $n_p\equiv 1\mod p$. Thus, $p=5$. $G$ acts on 6 $p$-Sylows, so we get an injective map from $G\hookrightarrow S_6$. How many powers of 5 can divide $|S_6|$? Only $5^1$, so we must have $n=1$. Thus, $|G|=6\cdot 5=30=5\cdot 3\cdot 2$. Applying Lemma 2 (3 distinct primes) finishes us off.
    \end{proof}
    \item Lemma 8: Assume $|G|=8p,9p$. Then $G$ is not simple.
    \begin{proof}
        Look at $n_p$. $n_p=1,2,4,8$ in the first case; $n_p=1,3,9$ in the second case. Lemma 4: Rule out $1,2,4$ and $1,3$. Thus, $n_p=8$ in the first case and $n_p=9$ in the second case.\par
        First case: $n_p=8$ and $n_p\equiv 1\mod p$. We must have $p=7$. Thus $|G|=8\cdot 7=56$. That's all we can get from the $p$-Sylow; now let's look at the 2-Sylow ($2^3=8$). $n_2=1,7$. We apply the $pqr$ too-many-elements style again. Number of elements of order 7 is $n_7(7-1)=8\cdot 6=48$. We have a group of 56 elements and 48 of them have order 7. So what's left? There are 8 elements left. But we know that the 2-Sylow has order 8, so let $P=G\setminus\{g\in G\mid |g|=7\}$. Then $|P|=8$. This implies that there is only one 2-Sylow, so $n_2=1$, meaning that the 2-Sylow is normal and giving us a contradiction.
    \end{proof}
    \item Again, we only have a contradiction because we are assuming $G$ is simple. If we don't assume $G$ is simple, we have a perfectly valid mathematical derivation of the properties of a group of order $8p$.
    \item Example: Let $G=A_4$. Then $|G|=12=3\cdot 2^2$, so $n_3=1,2,4$ and $n_3\equiv 1\mod 3$. The 3-Sylow in $A_4$ is not normal, so $n_p\neq 1$. $n_p\neq 2$ because $2\not\equiv 1\mod 3$. Thus, $n_3=4$ and therefore the number of elements of order 3 is $n_3(3-1)=4\cdot 2=8$. Thus, there are 12 elements $A_4$ minus 8 elements of order 3, so there are 4 elements left. These 4 elements compose the 2-Sylow, meaning that the 2-Sylow is normal. And here (where we're not assuming $G$ is simple), that's fine!
    \item So far: Continuing to build up and rule out groups of certain (mostly prime) factorizations.
    \item This will not classify all simple groups, but if we start taking $n$ to be small, we know the factorizations of small numbers tend to have a small number of prime factors. So can we classify all groups of small order? That's our task now.
    \item Lemma 9: If $|G|=84,126,140,156,175,189,198,200$, then $G$ is not simple.
    \begin{proof}
        $84=7\cdot 3\cdot 2^2$. Sylow III: $n_7\equiv 1\mod 7$ and $n_7\mid 12$, so $n_7=1$.\par
        $126=7\cdot 18$. Sylow III: $n_7\equiv 1\mod 7$, $n_7\mid 18$ implies $n_7=1$.\par
        $140=7\cdot 20$. Sylow III: $n_7\equiv 1\mod 7$, $n_7\mid 20$ implies $n_7=1$.\par
        $189=7\cdot 27$. Sylow III: $n_7\equiv 1\mod 7$, $n_7\mid 27$ implies $n_7=1$.\par\smallskip
        $176=11\cdot 16$. Sylow III: $n_{11}\equiv 1\mod 11$, $n_{11}\mid 16$ implies $n_{11}=1$.\par
        $176=11\cdot 18$. Sylow III: $n_{11}\equiv 1\mod 11$, $n_{11}\mid 18$ implies $n_{11}=1$.\par\smallskip
        $175=5^2\cdot 7$. Sylow III: $n_5\equiv 1\mod 5$, $n_5\mid 7$ implies $n_5=1$.\par
        $200=5^2\cdot 8$. Sylow III: $n_5\equiv 1\mod 5$, $n_5\mid 8$ implies $n_5=1$.\par\smallskip
        $156=13\cdot 12$. Sylow III: $n_{13}\equiv 1\mod 13$, $n_{13}\mid 12$ implies $n_{13}=1$.
    \end{proof}
    \item A bit messy and \emph{ad hoc}, but this covers the simple groups of certain orders we haven't covered so far.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If you do a random case for a small number, often it will be a bit like this.
    \end{itemize}
    \item For a bunch of small numbers, we immediately get without any work from the Sylow theorems a normal $p$-Sylow.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We actually get these conclusions for any groups of these orders??
    \end{itemize}
    \item This way of thinking lends itself to you generating your own problem; you basically choose a random number and look for a prime with $n_p=1$.
    \item Two more exceptional cases.
    \item Lemma 10: If $|G|=132$, then $G$ is not simple.
    \begin{proof}
        $132=11\cdot 12$, so $n_{11}=1,12$. If 1, we're done. If very large, we get that contradiction. The number of elements of order 11 is $n_{11}(11-1)=12\cdot 10=120$, so only 12 elements left. We now consider other primes. $11\cdot 12=11\cdot 3\cdot 2^2$. $n_3\equiv 1\mod 3$, $n_3\mid 44$. Thus, $n_3=1,2,4,11,22,44$. If 1, we're done. 2,11,44 can't happen because of the congruence law. If $n_3=4$, apply Lemma 4. Thus, $n_3=22$, so the number of elements of order 3 is $n_3(3-1)=22\cdot 2=44$. $120+44>132$, so we win.
    \end{proof}
    \item At this point, we've considered a bunch of easy general and special cases. At this point, let's look at the numbers under 200 we can rule out.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Calegari writes out all numbers from 1-200.
        \item For the prime numbers, there is a simple group of that order.
        \item Powers of primes, there is no simple group, so we can cross those off ($4=2^2,8=2^3,9=3^2,16=2^4,25=5^2,27=3^3,32=2^5,\dots$).
        \item Products of two primes, there is no simple group ($6=2\cdot 3,10=2\cdot 5,15=3\cdot 5,\dots$).
        \item Products of three distinct primes, there is no simple group ($30=2\cdot 3\cdot 5,42=2\cdot 3\cdot 7,\dots$).
        \item Everything that's $2p^n,3p^n,4p^n$, there is no simple group ($12=3\cdot 2^2,18=2\cdot 3^2,\dots$).
        \item Everything that's $5p^n$, there is no simple group ($20=5\cdot 2^2,40=5\cdot 2^3,\dots$).
        \item Everything that's $6p^n$, there is no simple group (just $150=6\cdot 5^2$). Only got one number with Lemma 7 :(
        \item Everything that's $8p,9p$, there is no simple group ($56=8\cdot 7,63=9\cdot 7,88=8\cdot 11,99=9\cdot 11,\dots$).
        \item Exceptional numbers done by hand: $84,126,132,140,156,175,189,198,200$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item There are no simple groups of order 1 by definition, so the trivial group is not a simple group much the same way 1 is not a prime number.
    \item At this point, we have to acknowledge that this list left out numbers, so we have to see what's left and then work with it.
    \item First numbers up: 60 (there does happen to be a simple group of this order here --- $A_5$), 72, 90.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Thus, if we have a simple group of order less than 100, it is of prime order or of order 60, 72, or 90 (note that we can still eliminate 72 and 90, but we haven't investigated them yet, so it's fair to include them here; not the most restrictive theorem, but a valid one all the same).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Next numbers up: 112, 120, 144, 168, 180.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Calegari really does have quite a fast mind as he's doing prime factorizations by memory.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Thus, using the lemmas, we've proven the following: A simple group of order at most 200 either has prime order, or order 60, 72, 90, 112, 120, 144, 168, or 180.
\end{itemize}
